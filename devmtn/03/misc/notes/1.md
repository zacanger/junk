so, `expressions`, basically that's why we're gonna be mashing those braces constantly. it's kind of like inline scripts, but minus the script tags?

`directives` are the powerful bit. jqueryish dom extension? apparently something we'll use a lot is `ngRepeat`, which, if it means writing less html, is a-ok with me.

```html
    <div>
	<div data-ng-repeat="user in users">
	<h4>{{user.name}}</h4>
	<p>{{user.properties}}</p>
	</div>
	</div>
```

so it's like how python folks write python everything, including html; we're writing javascriptish markup! it makes sense in those terms. that snippet there justcreated that same div for each user in users; say we have several user objects, it'll just go right ahead and repeat that markup per user.

`ngShow` determines if an element should be shown or not, based on a boolean.

```html
    <div data-ng=repeat="pizza in boxes" data-ng-show="pizza.topping == 'peppers'">
	<h4>{{pizza.shop}}</h4>
	<p>{{pizza.properties}}</p>
```

guess what. your gross-ass hawaiian pie? not in those divs, no sir.

`ngSwitch` OHH THIS IS USEFUL. we could've used this last week.

```html
    <div data-ng-switch="pizza.photo">
	<h3>{{pizza.stuff}}</h3>
	<p>your pie totally looks this goods</p>
	<img src="pepperoni.jpg" data-ng-switch-when="pepperoni">
	<img src="hawaiian.bmp" data-ng-switch-when="gross_as_ugh">
	<img src="heaven.png" data-ng-switch-when="peppers">
    </div>
```

directives straight up from angular ar all named `ngSomethingStuff`; they're used like "ng-something-stuff" (or "data-ng-something-stuff") in view. they can also be comments (?), dom elements, or CSS classes (oh hai jquery what up).

one could use 'operations' within those little handlebars up there (i believe we're calling those `expressions`, and `operations` would be our word for executable snippets, basically?). so `{{pizzza.beInMe()}}` is totally valid.

`ngModel` to create two-way data-binding.`

aaaaand i do believe this example just literally piped a username to uppercase. OKAY. `{{name | uppercase}}` that is, apparently, called a `filter`, though in the interest of correctness (and also just to irk ryan :P) i'll keep calling them pipes, thank you very much.

hmm. it would seem the guy who wrote this intro to angular is either getting paid by google, or currently sitting on someone's stuff there... some of the worship is just a wee bit too cloying for real life.

`ngApp` is the directive to include a partial (to bind an application, in the parlance). `ngView` to actually use it.

`.config` does (whodathunkit) configuration, basically by d i (?). you *could* pass a function with parameters named after what you're sourcing that way, but it's not good practice (actually, i hadn't thought about that before... what happens to variables by the time they've been through minification, base62, and gzip? ⊙▃⊙). instead, you should use an array with the names of the elements that should get all shot up in your page, because, y'know, ain't no one messing with your actual data.

`routes` are a big deal, from what i hear. here's a simple one from this guy's blog post:

```javascript
    angularStuff.config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
		$routeProvider.when('/objects', {
		  templateURI: 'view/objects.html',
		  controller: 'ObjCtrl'
		}).otherwise({ // REALLY? we're going with "OTHERWISE?"
		templateURI: 'view/NOPE.html'
    	});
	}]);
```

please forgive me, but i need to take a minute to say some things that should be obvious.

1. if/else is normal. that's usual. if/then/else/for/in/when, these are normal. these are common. but 'OTHERWISE' is just being a douchebag. you're a douchebag, angular.
2. yes, this way of working with partials and configs is pretty sweet, but let's be honest, here, and very straightforward: partials and templating systems and whatnot
  exist solely for the purpose of making things *easier* on the people doing the programming. somehow i feel like going with even more nested punctuation is more of an
  exercise in concrete poetry than a highly advanced and developed javascript framework. ugh.
3. okay. i'm done.

`.controller` is, like, what you use for controllers. `$scope` links your controllers and their bound views. (?) (or binded, if you're this fellow.)

```javascript
	angularThang.controller('BTCtrl', ['$scope', function ($scope) {
			$scope.objects = [
				{
				key: 'value',
				next: 'another'
				},
				{
				key: 'let\'s do it again',
				next: 'okay, now we\'re done'
				}
		];
	}]);
```

`$watch` calls a listener for a controller on an attribute of its scope (oh boy, pronouns, this is fun). `$broadcast` will trigger an event on a scope, which'll be transmitted to that scope, and *all* of its children. to trigger a global even, you'd use `$rootScope`. without copying down every example from this rather crudely typed out blog post, we're basically using `$scope.$watch(stuff)`, `$scope.$broadcast`, `$scope.$on` etc. so, y'know. extra `$$$$$$$$` for everyone.

obviously `services` are gonna be my favourite toy here. there's an `$http` builtin! (i think... as mentioned, this blogger is probably better at writing code that writing words, so... i don't really know). so you can inject them (oh geez, really? we're going with 'inject' here? we couldn't've said 'require' or 'load' or some other generic and often used term that could maybe be *slightly* less confusing in this context?) into your controllers and whatnots and fiddlybits, straight up. same goes for custom services/external/third-party/whatever, i suppose. basically you've just got to have some sort of usable api there for other services & fiddlywhatnots to access.

`$http` is a thin wrapper on XHR; `$resource` is higher level (though without any examples of how, all i have to go on is that you can call POST something like 'save' and get something like 'GIMME DAT' or whatever... so... what?). and i think `$resource` is *not* a builtin, because you'd need to have a dependency on `ngResource` to use it. and here he says we've got `$httpBackend` built in to test without a web server, but he doesn't mention if that's actually a builtin or a core module that would need to be required, nor does he mention whether or not it runs a webserver itself or just sends out a fake packet, internally, or whatever.
