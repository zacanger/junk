react is reacty. it reacts, sometimes reactively.

it's still ugly as hell and i hope it dies, though.

note that i'm doing all this in vim because A. lighttable doesn't like react and B. lighttable has my projects loadded up, currently, and i don't want to add yet another workspace. so, this will probably all be formatted like crap, because vim doesn't understand, no matter how many times i tell it, that i don't want it to turn spaces into tabs, i want the opposite.

oh well.
