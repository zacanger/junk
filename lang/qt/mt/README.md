"Minimal" qtermwidget-based terminal, plus a decent theme.

To build and install, `make && sudo make install`.

### WHY:

Why not? qtermwidget supports fonts with ligatures, which is nice. But qterminal
itself is gigantic and is configured through menus and buttons and crap. I
wanted something that's just... a terminal. Also I want to learn more QT.
